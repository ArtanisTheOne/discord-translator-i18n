### Translating Variables

Some strings contain variables, these are not meant to be translated, keep them intact like the following example:

English
```
Hello %s, how are you?
%d messages translated today.
```

German
```
Hallo %s, wie gehts?
%d Nachrichten heute Ã¼bersetzt.
```

`%s` refers to names/words (strings)

`%d` refers to numbers (digits)

<br>

### Text Formatters

Some messages may contain special formatting characters, such as `**` and `__` or `[word](%s)`, these are Markdown special characters, which styles words as **bold**, _underline_ etc. Here are some examples of correct translation in these cases:

English
```
__Hello **%s**__, how are you [today](%s)?
```
German
```
__Hallo **%s**__, wie geht es dir [heute](%s)?
```

<br>

### Contextual Translations

Some message strings contain a `context` note to help you understand the meaning more clearly, for example:

```
context: user

en: %s has been banned

de: %s wurde gebannt
```

If no context is provided, you are advised to provide a general translation.

<br>

### Gender

If your locale language translates `you` or `your` to a specific gender, then please use the equivalent of `they`, `them` and `their` for general/neutral addressing.

<br>

### Translating Commands

The commands strings in `commands.po` must be translated as one word and all lowercase.
If one word is impossible, then you can use `-` instead of spaces ` `, for example:

> `a command` -> `a-command`

<br>

### Main English Texts

If you feel that the original English texts can be better, you are welcome to suggest improvements.

<br>

### Notes Summary

* Keep formatting intact
* Keep punctuation (`,.`) and newlines (`\n`)
* Use context when translating
* Gender-neutral translation
* Commands as lowercase and one word
